EC2 Instance Families 


m(m4,m5,m6) 
            General Purpose .Balance of compute , memory and networking 
            Use Cases :: Genral Purpose : Web servers and code repositories 

t(t2,t3,t3a)
            Burstable Performance instances (accumulate CPU credits when inactive). Unlimited burstable mode 
            Use Cases :: Workloads with spikes : web servers , developer environments and small databases  
            Example : t2.micro 
            Instances gather CP:U Credits while they are idle 
            CPU credits can be consumed at a later point in time (upto a maximum CPU Credit)
            Usecase :: Workloads with sudden spikes - Test Environments 




c(c4,c5,c5n)
            Compute Optimized : High performance processors
            Use Cases :: Batch processing , high performance http servers , high performance computing (HPC) 

r(r4,r5,r5a,r5n)
             Memory (RAM) optimised
             Memory Caches , in-memory databases and real time big data analytics   


i(i3,d2)
        Storage (I/O)  optiomized 
        NoSQL databases and data warehousing 
        

g(g3,g4)  
        GPU optimized
        Floating point number calculations , graphics processing , or video compression

f(f1)
       FPGA instances-customizable field programmable gate arrays 
       Use Cases :: Applications needing massively parallel processing power , such as genomics , data analytics , video processing and financial computing 

inf(inf1)
          Machine Learning ASIC instances 
          Use Cases :: Machine Learning applications such as image recognition , sppech recognition , natural language processing and personalization.
